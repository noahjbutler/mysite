            <h2>Seychelles - Masayoshi Takanaka</h2>
            <p>
                This album is the epitome of happiness. It has the power to pull you out of any mood you might find yourself in. In the eye of a hurricane, you could listen to this album and find yourself on the Seychelles islands. 
            </p>
            <p>My favorite track on this album is FUJI. It gives me goosebumps on every listen. This song is almost too good for me. It's an escape from the reality and harsships of life. For four and a half minutes, you're transported into an alternative universe where peak happiness is the only emotion. </p>

            <h2>Utopia - Travis Scott</h2>
            <p>
                This album is an unbelievable follow to an unfollowable act that was Travis' previous record. 
            </p>
            <p> My favorite song from this record is Parasail. After going through some forums discussing this album, I've found this song to be quite controversial. Some love it, some despise it. While I can understand a listener who thinks this song doesn't fit on the album, I see it as a perfect and neccessary interlude to an already emotional and psychadellic track list. This is a song you need to listen to with your eyes closed to get the full experience. The instrumental rocks in the background and reminds me of a rowboat roocking in the waves of a dark ocean.The simple vocals describe how Travis is learning to forgive himself for his concert incident and he's waiting for better days to come. </p>

            <h2>The Versace Tape - Boldy James, Jay Versace</h2>
            <p>
                The production on this album is top notch and Boldy's notorious vocals are a cherry on top for the listener. Despite Boldy's unique, flawless, and confident delivery, I find myself singing along to Jay's beats more than I do to Boldy's verses. I used to watch Jay Versace when he made Vines 10 years ago, and when I first loistened to this album I had no idea he was even a producer -- never the less for Boldy James. 
            </p>

            <p>My favorite track on this album is Bentayga. The opening scence of Jay's production on this song is so addictive to me. There's no word to describe this sample other than delightful. Again, I find myself singing and swaying to the sample more tha Boldy's verses. And that isn't to say Boldy's verse is weak by any standards, that confidence he brings to any track just oozes through this song. This fast paced vocal heavy beat is so complex yet Boldy so nonchalantly recites his metaphores and story. I'll never get tired of this one.  </p>

            <h2>Anti - Rihanna</h2>
            <p>
                This album is a great mix of electronic and acoustic elements. The artist has 
                really pushed the boundaries of their sound with this release, incorporating a 
                variety of genres while staying true to their core. Standout tracks include "Track A" 
                and "Track B". Definitely a must-listen for fans of experimental music.
